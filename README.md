Data Structures

We used the library Sytem.Linq which allows us to string together several methods insdtead of having them accross multiple lines.

For the string reversal we started with a Console.WriteLine asking for user to input a string to be reveresed.

Next, we declared called a method StringReversal and passed the argument of user input.

Then, created the method StriReversal with arguments string and entry.

The reversal works as follows, first a new string which gets turned into an array with .ToCharArray, the order of charachters in the
	array are reversed with .Reverse, and then the array is stringified with .ToArray, and this is displayed with a Console.WriteLine.  

Finaly the Console.Read allows the user an opportunity to view the result.
